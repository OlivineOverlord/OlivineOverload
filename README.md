#### Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [The Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/) at The University of Cambridge. 

My research focuses on topics in experimental petrology and analytical geochemistry. Currently, I'm involved in a variety of projects, including investigating mantle phase transitions under stress, mineral-melt ion partitioning, pressure treatment on olivine phosphates that are used as cathodes in Li-ion batteries, and machine learning applications to XRF mapping of experimental charges and radiogenic isotopes from continental basalts.
