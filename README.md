#### Hello there!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [The Department of Earth Sciences](https://www.esc.cam.ac.uk/staff/dr-joshua-shea) at The University of Cambridge. 

My research focuses on carbon in Earth's mantle and its journey from mantle reservoirs to the atmosphere. I'm broadly interested in experimental petrology, igneous and metamorphic petrology, planetary geology, and analytical geochemistry. Currently, I'm involved in multiple projects, including mantle and igneous geochemistry of Mars, mineral-melt ion partitioning, the petrology and geochemistry of ultrapotassic melts in eastern Australia, lithium-phosphate olivine cathodes, and applying machine learning to spectral data.
