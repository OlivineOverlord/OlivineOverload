### Hello there ðŸ‘‹  I'm [Josh Shea](https://github.com/OlivineOverlord).

I am a postdoctoral research associate in the [Department of Materials](https://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/) at The University of Manchester. I am an experimental petrologist and igneous geochemist. My interests are in chemical process in the mantle under both sub- and super-solidus conditions. 

- ðŸ”­   Iâ€™m currently working mantle phase transitions under stress
- ðŸŒ±   Iâ€™m currently learning how to quantify XRF and apply machine learning to geochemical data
- ðŸ’¬   Ask me about anything!
