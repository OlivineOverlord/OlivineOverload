#### Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in [The Department of Materials](https://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/) at The University of Manchester. 

My research focuses on topics in experimental petrology and analytical geochemistry. Currently, I'm involved in a variety of projects, including investigating mantle phase transitions under stress, mineral-melt ion partitioning, pressure and redox treatment on olivine cathodes for Li-ion batteries, and machine learning applications to XRF mapping and continental basalt radiogenic isotope systems.
