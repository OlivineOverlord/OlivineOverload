### Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is Josh, and I'm a Postdoctoral Research Associate at The University of Manchester in [The Department of Materials](https://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/). My research focuses on experimental petrology and analytical geochemistry, and I'm always exploring new and exciting areas of study.

Currently, I'm involved in a variety of projects, including investigating mantle phase transitions, studying mineral-melt partitioning, researching pressure treatment on olivine cathodes, exploring machine learning applications to XRF mapping.
